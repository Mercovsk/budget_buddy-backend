BUDGET BUDDY API

This is a personal project. I created this project because of the money manager app I am currently using. I encounter a limitation in the number of accounts so I decided to create my own project wherein the model will be based from it with additionoal features. As of now, I have not think about any customization but still it is a progress for me to showcase what can I do because of my curiosity.

As of now this is just the backend system. I will try to create a frontend system for this so that I can use it wherever I am either using a mobile application or a web application.
